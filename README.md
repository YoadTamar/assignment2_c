# Software System 1 - second assignment
second assignment in "Software System 1" course at Ariel University
##Description
This small C programs do some calculations on an undirected graph, which is represented by a square matrix.

Neighborhood matrix is a method for representing a directed or undirected graph with N nodes (vertices), using a square matrix whose size is NxN and whose cell values​​are 0 or a positive number. Cell (i,j) in the graph describes the weight of the arc from vertex i to vertex j in the graph. If there is no such arc, the value in the cell in the matrix will be 0. If there is such an arc, the value will be a positive number and it will represent the weight of the transition from vertex i to vertex j.
